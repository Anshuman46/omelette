Step 1: Season the beaten eggs well with salt and pepper. Heat the oiland butter in a non-stick frying pan over a medium-low heat until the butter has melted and is foaming.

Step 2: Pour the eggs into the pan, tilt thr pan over so sightly from one end to another to allow the eggs swirl and cover the surface of the pan completely. Let the mixture cook for about 20 seconds then scrap a line through the middle with a spatula.

Step 3: Tilt the pan again to allow it to fill back up with the runny egg. Repeat once or twice untilthe egg has just set.

Step 4: At this point you can fill the omelette with whatever you like - some grated cheese, sliced ham or fresh herbs too. Scatter the filling over the top of the omelette and fold it gently in half with spatula.
